<p>本遊戲除了普通的敵人外，另外還有多種強大的Boss，除了字數較長外，還各自擁有不同的技能。</p> <h3 id=\\\"特殊功能\\\">特殊功能</h3> <p>當身邊有太多敵人即將接近，而且來不及將他們消滅的時候，玩家在每場遊戲，有三次的機會可以使用技能。按下&quot;Enter&quot;釋放出電磁脈衝(EMP)，快速的將身邊的敵人消滅。</p> <h3 id=\\\"圖形美術\\\">圖形/美術</h3> <p>我們遊戲圖形是以8 BITS復古風作為設計風格，它最大的特色就是在圖形的邊緣，看起來會有明顯的鋸齒。為了達成像素畫(Pixel Art) 的美術風格，大部分的圖形我們都是利用<strong>小畫家</strong>來繪製。和一般的繪圖軟體相比，小畫家非常適合來製作點陣圖，因為他可以很精確的在每一格中填色，並且可以很輕易的輸出Bmp格式的圖片，正好符合我們的需求。</p> <h2 id=\\\"說明畫面\\\">說明畫面</h2> <p><img src=\\\"\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACEMENT_4___

官方帳號的形式，讓用戶輕鬆簡單地報名參賽，瀏覽各賽事的詳細資訊，還有查看當前比賽進度等功能。目前用戶數已超過 4,000 人，全台從北到南，共計有 24 所大專院校的音樂社團與我們成為合作夥伴。</p> <p>而對於主辦比賽的社團成員們，樂台計畫提供一套完整的後台管理系統。 在此項目中本人負責的是<strong>後台管理系統</strong>開發與部分 Line App <strong>UI/UX

<p>樂台計畫在建立初期，其實並沒有打算規劃官方網站。但隨著規模漸漸成長，有越來越多的人與音樂社團對我們感到好奇，也考量到樂台計畫品牌和形象的推廣。為了可以接觸到更多群眾，讓更多人可以透過 Facebook 粉絲專頁以外的管道來認識我們，於是我便開始著手網站的設計。</p> <h2 id=\\\"舊版網站\\\">舊版網站</h2> <p>在前期版本，網站原本的定位僅僅是希望提供一個簡易的入口，引導使用者加入樂台計畫 Line App。因此當時主要是朝著單頁式網站的方向來設計，頁面上也只放置了 QRCode 等必要資訊。</p> <p>為了盡快的製作出 prototype，當時選用 Parcel 這個簡單又快速的打包工具。只要設定好進入點，它就會自動分析所有相依的資源，並自動封裝成 bundle，也減少了很多需要手動配置的地方。</p> <p><img src=\\\"\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACEMENT_1___ + \"\\\" alt=\\\"早期網站首頁\\\"></p> <h2 id=\\\"以-nuxtjs-重新架構\\\">以 Nuxt.js 重新架構</h2> <p>隨著網站的內容逐漸擴充，依序加入了「合作院校」、「聯絡我們」、「最新消息」和「FAQ」等區塊，我也思考如何優化網站 SEO，於是在後期決定改採用 Nuxt.js 這個 SSR 解決方案，重新架構整個網站。</p> <p>在遷移到 Nuxt.js 後我體會到許多好處，最明顯的是就是它可以預先抓取異步資料，並且直接把內容渲染在頁面上。其他像是 title、meta description 和 Open Graph 標籤等，也可以透過 Vue Meta 管理，一併預先渲染出來，讓搜尋引擎的爬蟲可以更容易爬到。</p> <p>例如在社群媒體或是通訊軟體分享最新消息的文章時，其中縮圖和文章內容就能夠順利的被平台抓取，直接秀出預覽的資訊，提升使用者對連結的興趣。</p> <p><img src=\\\"\" + ___HTML_LOADER_REPLACEMENT_2___ + \"\\\"
